# PowerRankNFL

This repository contains the source code for my NFL Power Ranking model as well as the output data.

This model uses Weighted Expected Points Added (WEPA). The WEPA model and code I used was created by [Robby Greer](https://github.com/greerreNFL). 
More about WEPA [**HERE**](https://www.nfeloapp.com/analysis/weighted-EPA-methodology-and-performance):

Source code for WEPA written by Robby Greer, can be found [**HERE**](https://github.com/greerreNFL/wepa_v2).

The code to generate WEPA in this repo can be found [**HERE**](https://github.com/adriancm93/PowerRankNFL/tree/main/WEPA).

 I did not write the source code nor created the algorithm to create WEPA.
